      <h2>Our Project</h2>
      <p>Our CS109/Stat121 Final Project is entitled "Give It Five Stars! A Data Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews."<br><br>
      We've all been shopping online before - it's fast, it's convenient and there's often a wider selection of products than the local brick and mortar store. However, with this greater selection often comes uncertainty over the product that we are purchasing. We can't walk into the store, touch it, try it out or speak to a sales representative who will give us important buying information.
      <br><br>
      Thus enter the product review. Other consumers have theoretically purchased the product in question, tried it out and taken the time to write a review and possibly give a numerical rating online as well. Amazon provides for a numerical rating on a whole number scale of 1 to 5, and allows space for a text review.
      <br><br>
      Our project delves into the relationship between this numerical review, the text review, product category and other factors to determine how much consumers should actually be trusting online product reviews. Please explore our results with the video and links to the side. It may change how you view your daily trips to Amazon, Zappos and more!</p>
